You will need to supply a json file called setup.json with your MQTT id, password, server, port and topic.
It should also contain the name of the database file that will be created to hold the data. 

The format should look like this

{
    "user":"xxxxxxxx",
    "key":"xxxxxxxxx",
    "server":"xxx.xxxxx.xxx",
    "port":"xxxxx",
    "topic":"xxxxxx",
    "databaseFile":"xxxxx.db"
}
